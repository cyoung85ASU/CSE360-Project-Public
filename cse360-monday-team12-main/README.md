# Monday Team 12 Q&A System Project

This is the repository for CSE 360 Monday Team 12.

The project aims to implement a question and answer system for other CSE 360 students to use, allowing them to ask questions that will be easily and efficiently answered with reviewed results, essentially being a better source for significant answers than a usual search engine. This works through the process of other students' questions being answered, overall broadening the variety of already answered questions.

*(Currently in phase 2/4 of the project.)*
